# Indian Cricket Player Management System
A full-stack MERN application featuring API calls, CRUD operations, and a MongoDB-backed player collection.

# **Indian Cricket Player Management System: A MERN Journey**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Indian Cricket Player Management System**, a full-stack MERN application that lets you manage and interact with cricket players seamlessly. Built as a final project, this system integrates all the concepts we've learned, showcasing the power of the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

This application serves as a **dynamic platform** where users can manage players, track their statistics, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations—all while building a robust backend and a sleek, interactive frontend.


## **🚀 Project Features**

The **Indian Cricket Player Management System** provides a seamless experience for managing cricket players through the following functionalities:

- **Player Management**: Add, update, and delete player profiles easily. 
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search for players by name or position.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A React-powered interface makes the experience smooth and dynamic.

## **🔧 Technologies Used**

Our project is built using modern tools and frameworks that allow us to create a **robust and scalable application**. Here’s a breakdown:

- **MongoDB**: The database for storing cricket player data, with a NoSQL structure that handles large amounts of unstructured data.
- **Express.js**: The backend framework for Node.js, enabling us to define routes and manage CRUD operations seamlessly.
- **React.js**: The frontend library for building interactive UIs, helping us create a dynamic interface for the user to interact with.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for server-side JavaScript, making it the foundation of our backend logic.
- **MERN Stack**: The combination of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js forms the backbone of this application.
- **Vite**: The superfast development environment for React, providing lightning-fast builds and refreshes.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud-based development environment for easy collaboration and live code sharing.

## **💻 How it Works**

### **Frontend (React.js)**

1. **Player Display**: We retrieve and display a list of players using React's **useEffect** to fetch data from the backend. 
2. **Add New Player**: A form is provided to submit new players, which sends a **POST** request to the server.
3. **Update Player**: Existing player data can be edited, and the changes are sent through a **PUT** request.
4. **Delete Player**: A **DELETE** request removes a player’s profile from the system.
5. **Search Players**: A search bar filters players dynamically, querying the backend based on user input.

### **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)**

1. **RESTful API**: The backend exposes **RESTful routes** to handle CRUD operations:
   - **GET** /players: Fetches the list of all players.
   - **GET** /players/:id: Fetches a specific player by their unique ID.
   - **POST** /players: Adds a new player to the database.
   - **PUT** /players/:id: Updates existing player data.
   - **DELETE** /players/:id: Deletes a player based on their ID.
2. **MongoDB**: MongoDB Atlas is used as the cloud database to store player profiles. We use **Mongoose** to communicate with the database and perform operations.


## **🔓 How to Execute**
1.	Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/sharanbingewar/MERN_Final_Project.git

2. Install Dependencies
Once the project is cloned, you need to install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.
cd Indian-Cricket-Player-Management-System/server
npm install express
npm install mongoose
npm install cors
npm install body-parser

Now, navigate to the frontend directory and install the client-side dependencies:
cd ../client
npm install
npm install react-scripts
npm install axios

3. Set Up Environment Variables
You will need to configure the environment variables for the backend (Node.js) to work with MongoDB Atlas or your local MongoDB instance. Create a .env file inside the `server` folder and add the following:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://sbingewar9999:ij6hzkPL89UAnk5r@cricketteamcluster.devyf.mongodb.net/IndianCricketteam?retryWrites=true&w=majority

PORT=5003 

4. Run the Application:
Now that all dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can run both the backend and frontend of the application.
•	Start the backend: server
cd ../server
server % node server.js
•	Start the frontend: client
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client folder, then run:
cd ../client
client % npm start

5. Test the API Using Postman:
To test the backend API functionality (CRUD operations) directly, you can use Postman. 
http://localhost:5003/api/players

6. Test the Frontend in the Browser:
Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can test the user interface:
URL: Go to `http://localhost:5003 in your browser. Where you can add, update, delete, and search for players directly through the user interface.


## **⚙️ Challenges & Solutions**

**1. CORS Errors**  
We faced **CORS issues** while trying to access the backend API from the frontend. Solution: Implemented a simple **CORS middleware** in Express to resolve cross-origin request problems.

**2. Data Validation**  
Validating data before saving it to the database is critical. Mongoose was used to define validation rules for player data, such as ensuring names are not empty or invalid.

**3. Search Functionality**  
Initially, our search was slow. We optimized the search query by using **MongoDB text search** and limiting the number of results shown.


## **🔮 Future Improvements**

Here are some ideas we’re considering for the future:
- **User Authentication**: We plan to integrate **JWT-based authentication** so users can log in and manage their player profiles securely.
- **Statistics Dashboard**: A real-time dashboard that displays player stats, such as runs scored, wickets taken, etc.
- **Responsive UI**: Making the UI more mobile-friendly and responsive, improving user experience on different devices.


## **📢 A Final Note**

This project represents the culmination of various concepts, from building CRUD operations with Express to building a dynamic and interactive frontend with React. It highlights the importance of **full-stack development** and demonstrates how a well-structured stack like MERN can help solve real-world problems in an elegant and scalable manner.
